## Problem Statement & Solution

When it comes to creating shopping lists using notes apps on our phones have been a great step-up from the traditional method of writing it down on paper. Using our phones allow us to share the list more easily and we're less likely to lose it since our phones are always at our finger tips. However, despite this, there are still some shortcomings that make the sharing of shopping lists less than foolproof.

1. There isn't an easy way of sharing progress of the list in real time when using a notes app
2. Things like the specific type of a product can get lost in translation leading to the wrong product being purchased
3. Sharing the notes doesn't create a centralised space - it typically involves copy and pasting or separate copies of the list

This is where the 'Foolproof Shopping App' comes in. Our app aims to address these shortcomings listed above in following ways by:

1. Allowing users to share their shopping list via QR code or URL where ownder and anyone with access can see it
2. Including an image field for shopping list items, giving users the option to upload 1-2 images of the product to help make finding the correct product easier
3. Making the shopping list accessible on the web or in their native mobile app
